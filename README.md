# Type Independent LinkedList
A LinkedList without templates which Node class can be inherited.

## Benefits of this implementation
As can be seen in the example main.cpp, this implementation allows the user to make different classes inherit from Node and add them to the same LinkedList.

This can be useful for tasks line function pipelines, where each step is expected to have different parameters or even different outputs.
